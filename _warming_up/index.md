This first section presents a few simple, non-controversial rules, with the purpose of easing the reader into the site's format.

Most of these rules are not Scala specific and probably familiar to a lot of readers already, but they should not be skipped - ignoring them caused me an embarrassing number of afternoons spent looking for the cause of behaviours I would have sworn could not possibly happen.
