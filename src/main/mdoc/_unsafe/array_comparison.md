> When comparing two arrays for equality, use [`sameElements`] rather than `==`.

# Reason

`==` does not compare arrays for value equality, but for [reference equality].

This gives us the following counter-intuitive behaviour:

```scala mdoc
Array(1) == Array(1)
```

This is because [`Array`] is essentially an alias for Java's array, which implements [`equals`] as [reference equality] - only returning `true` if two variables point to the same array instance.

[`sameElements`], on the other hand, has the behaviour you'd expect:

```scala mdoc
Array(1) sameElements Array(1)
```

# Alternatives

An alternative to [`sameElements`] is calling [`deep`] on each array before comparison:

```scala mdoc
Array(1).deep == Array(1).deep
```

This is not the preferred solution because it's slightly more expensive, creating instances that will be discarded immediately.
