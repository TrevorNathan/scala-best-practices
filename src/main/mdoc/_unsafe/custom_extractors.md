title: Do not return Option from custom extractors

> When defining a custom extractor that happens to be [total](../definitions/total_function.html), always have a return type of [`Some`] rather than [`Option`].

# Reason

This is a bit convoluted and has to do with exhaustivity checking in pattern matching, by which I mean:

```scala mdoc:fail
def unwrap(oi: Option[Int]): Int = oi match {
  case Some(i) => i
}
```

You get a warning here because there are values of `oi` that would cause your code to fail at runtime.

A common misconception about this check is that you get a warning whenever the compiler fails to prove exhaustivity. What actually happens is slightly different: you'll get a warning whenever the compiler succeeds in proving non-exhaustivity.

The distinction is subtle, but important: when the compiler cannot find a concrete value that is not covered by a pattern match, even though it knows such a value might exist, it will not warn.

And if your custom extractor returns [`Option`], that's exactly what happens: it's telling the compiler that there might be values for which it's not defined, but it doesn't tell it *which* values. This effectively disables exhaustivity checking.

Here's a concrete example:

```scala mdoc
object ExtractSome {
  def unapply[A](s: Some[A]): Option[A] = s
}
```

Using this code, we can write the following pattern match:

```scala mdoc
def unwrap(oi: Option[Int]): Int = oi match {
  case ExtractSome(i) => i
}
```

We're not getting a warning, even though our pattern match is clearly non-exhaustive: it'll fail on [`None`].

```scala mdoc:crash
unwrap(None)
```

The presence of an extractor whose return type is [`Option`] disabled exhaustivity checking, even in the presence of concrete values that are not covered by the pattern match.

Let's change our custom extractor to return a [`Some`]:

```scala mdoc:reset
object ExtractSome {
  def unapply[A](s: Some[A]): Some[A] = s
}
```

This is a subtle difference that changes everything: [`Some`] means that our extractor will always succeed, allowing the compiler to look for further proof of non-exhaustivity (and find it):

```scala mdoc:fail
def unwrap(oi: Option[Int]): Int = oi match {
  case ExtractSome(i) => i
}
```

# Improvement

An even better rule of thumb would be to either not define custom extractors, or at least never define partial ones - pattern match exhaustivity is something that most people take for granted, and sneakily disabling it can lead to all sorts of unpleasant runtime behaviours.
