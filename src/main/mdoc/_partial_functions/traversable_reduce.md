> When reducing a collection to a single value, prefer [`reduceOption`] to [`reduce`].

# Reason

Some collections are empty, and [`reduce`] deals with them by throwing an exception:

```scala mdoc:crash
Seq.empty[Int].reduce(_ + _)
```

[`reduceOption`] is a safer alternative, since it encodes the possibility of the empty list in its return type:

```scala mdoc
Seq(1, 2, 3).reduceOption(_ + _)

Seq.empty[Int].reduceOption(_ + _)
```
