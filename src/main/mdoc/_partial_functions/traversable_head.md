> When retrieving the head of a sequence, use [`headOption`] rather than [`head`].

# Reason

Some collections are empty, and [`head`] deals with them by throwing an exception:

```scala mdoc:crash
Seq.empty[Int].head
```

[`headOption`] is a safer alternative, since it encodes the possibility of the empty list in its return type:

```scala mdoc
Seq(1, 2, 3).headOption

Seq.empty[Int].headOption
```
