> When creating an [ADT] to represent errors, have the base type extend [`Exception`].

# Reason

Some APIs, such as the standard [`Try`] and [`Future`], represent errors through exceptions. If your error type doesn't extend [`Exception`], you cannot stick it in a [`Failure`], for example.

Let's say we have this simple [ADT] for database-related errors:

```scala mdoc
sealed abstract class DbError extends Product with Serializable

object DbError {
  final case object InvalidSql extends DbError
  final case object ConnectionLost extends DbError
}
```

And for whatever reason, we need to implement the following method:

```scala
def foo(i: Int): Try[Int]
```

With our current `DbError` implementation, it's impossible to write something like:

```scala mdoc:fail
def foo(i: Int) = scala.util.Failure(DbError.InvalidSql)
```

Had `DbError` extended [`Exception`] however, this would have been perfectly possible:

```scala mdoc:reset
sealed abstract class DbError extends Exception with Product with Serializable

object DbError {
  final case object InvalidSql extends DbError
  final case object ConnectionLost extends DbError
}

def foo(i: Int) = scala.util.Failure(DbError.InvalidSql)
```

# Secondary reason

There's another reason for this rule, although I find it dubious.

Imagine you have two different error [ADTs][ADT] - our `DbError` one, and another that's more about business logic:

```scala mdoc
sealed abstract class UserError extends Exception with Product with Serializable

object UserError {
  final case object NotFound extends UserError
  final case object Unauthorized extends UserError
}
```

If you try to write a function that attempts to find a user in database and validate its password, its error type is either a `DbError` or a `UserError`. There are ways to represent that - [`Either`] (but that gets messy very quickly if we have more than 2 error types) or a unifying [ADT] that wraps both types, for instance.

Had both `DbError` and `UserError` extended [`Exception`], we'd have a third option: [`Exception`] being a sort of universal supertype for errors, we could just say that our error type is [`Exception`] and the compiler would be perfectly happy.

I personally dislike this approach. It removes the compiler's ability to check whether you've dealt with all error cases. You must manually choose which subtypes of [`Exception`] you want to deal with, and the compiler has no way of knowing if you've dealt with all error types for a given call, or if the types you deal with are actually possible in a given context.
